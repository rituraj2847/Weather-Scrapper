<h1>Weather-Scrapper</h1>
This application was made using PHP, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML
<p>It makes use of the public api made available by <b>OpenWeatherMap</b>. It simply parses the json file fetched from the api and gives details about the weather conditions like :</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather Description</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Wind Speed</li>
<li>Time of Sunrise</li>
<li>Time of Sunset</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

1. To run this, you will need LAMP installed on your Linux machine. See <a href="http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu"> here</a><br>
2. Wherever you've cloned this on your computer, copy from that location to /var/www/html directory using the command<br>
  `sudo cp from/path/{back.png,WScrapper.php} /var/www/html/`<br>
3. Now simply type http://localhost//WScrapper.php and hit enter.

Any changes aimed at improving the app are welcome.
